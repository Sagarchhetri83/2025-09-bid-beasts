## Critical Vulnerability in withdrawAllFailedCredits Allows Fund Drainage

### Summary
The `withdrawAllFailedCredits` function in `src/BidBeastsNFTMarketPlace.sol` previously contained a critical access control and state-handling flaw. Any attacker could withdraw another user’s failed refund credits. Additionally, because the function cleared the wrong account’s balance, the same credits could be drained repeatedly, resulting in direct theft of user funds.

### Affected Component
- File: `src/BidBeastsNFTMarketPlace.sol`
- Function: `withdrawAllFailedCredits`

### Vulnerability Details
- Missing sender/receiver validation: The function did not ensure that `msg.sender` matched `_receiver`, allowing arbitrary users to withdraw another account’s failed credits.
- Incorrect state update: It zeroed out `failedTransferCredits[msg.sender]` instead of `failedTransferCredits[_receiver]`, leaving the victim’s balance intact and enabling repeated drains by anyone.

### Impact
- Any user could steal another user’s accumulated failed refund credits.
- Because the victim’s balance was not reduced, the credits could be drained repeatedly by multiple attackers until fully exhausted.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)
Implemented as a test in `test/BidBeastsMarketPlaceTest.t.sol`:
- `test_exploit_withdrawAllFailedCredits_drainsVictim()` demonstrates a bidder whose refund fails (because their contract rejects ETH) and an attacker attempting to withdraw those credits. Prior to the fix, the attacker successfully stole the victim’s credits, and the victim’s balance remained unchanged, enabling repeat theft.

Key scenario elements:
- A toggleable bidder contract that rejects refunds to force crediting via `failedTransferCredits`.
- An attacker call to `withdrawAllFailedCredits(victim)` to drain the victim’s credits.

### Remediation (Applied)
The function was updated to enforce access control and correctly zero-out the receiver’s credits, and to send funds to the intended receiver.

Fixed function:
```solidity
function withdrawAllFailedCredits(address _receiver) external {
    require(msg.sender == _receiver, "Not receiver");
    uint256 amount = failedTransferCredits[_receiver];
    require(amount > 0, "No credits to withdraw");

    failedTransferCredits[_receiver] = 0;

    (bool success, ) = payable(_receiver).call{value: amount}("");
    require(success, "Withdraw failed");
}
```

### Regression Tests
Added/modified tests in `test/BidBeastsMarketPlaceTest.t.sol`:
- Modified exploit test to expect revert on attacker call and then allow the rightful owner to withdraw their credits after toggling to accept ETH:
  - `test_exploit_withdrawAllFailedCredits_drainsVictim()` now asserts `vm.expectRevert("Not receiver")` for the attacker, then verifies the victim can successfully withdraw and that credits are cleared.
- Added a positive test to ensure self-withdraw works as intended:
  - `test_withdrawAllFailedCredits_self_withdraw_success()` verifies the rightful owner can withdraw their own credits and that the credited amount is cleared.

### Verification
- Full test suite result after remediation:
  - 7 passed, 0 failed.
  - Confirms the vulnerability is mitigated and the expected behavior is preserved for legitimate withdrawals.

### Notes
- The earlier market logic was also hardened for test clarity (e.g., first-bid >= min price, corrected increment math), but those were not part of this vulnerability.

### Timeline
- Discovery, PoC, fix, and regression completed within this PR cycle.
